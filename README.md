# Spam Classification with LSTM

This repository contains a simple spam classification model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

- Loads and preprocesses the spam dataset.
- Utilizes pre-trained GloVe word embeddings for text representation.
- Builds an LSTM neural network for spam classification.
- Trains the model and evaluates its performance.
- Provides a function for making predictions on new text messages.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the code:
Download pre-trained word vectors(GloVe) from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
